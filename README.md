Leaflet.favorDoubleClick
========================

Leaflet plugin to favor double-click events over single-click events.

[Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) favors single-click events over double-click events. For example, if you double-click 
to zoom the map but happen to hit a marker you will get a popup instead of a zoom.

This plugin allows enabling the reverse behavior where double-click events are favored over single-click events.

Try the [demo](http://azavea.github.io/Leaflet.favorDoubleClick).
